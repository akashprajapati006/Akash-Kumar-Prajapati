I believe I am fit for this role because I combine the solid technical foundation with a passion for the innovation. During my M.Tech in VLSI Design at NIT Jalandhar, I have gained the strong hands on experience with Verilog, Cadence Virtuoso, Synopsys VCS. I also learned basics of System Verilog and TCL which is mainly used in the industries.
